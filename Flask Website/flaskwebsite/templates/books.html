            When you have to kill the same terrorist twice in one week, there's either something wrong with your  world or something wrong with your skills... and there's nothing wrong with Joe Ledger's skills.
             Ledger, a Baltimore detective assigned to a counterterrorism task force, is recruited by the government to lead a new ultrasecret rapid-response group called the Department of Military Sciences (DMS) to help stop a group of
            terrorists from releasing a dreadful bio-weapon that can turn ordinary people
           ` into zombies.

            We survived the zombie apocalypse, but how many of us are still haunted by that terrible time?  We have (temporarily?) defeated the living dead, but at what cost? Told in the haunting and <br> riveting voices of the men and women who witnessed
            the horror firsthand, World War Z is the  only record of the apocalyptic years.

            "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains."  So begins Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, an expanded edition of the beloved Jane Austen novel featuring all-new scenes
            of bone-crunching zombie mayhem.

            The year was 2014. We had cured cancer. We had beat the common cold. But in doing so we created something new, something terrible that no one could stop. The infection spread, virus blocks taking over bodies and minds with one, unstoppable
            command: FEED.
